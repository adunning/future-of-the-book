Assessment is weighted as follows:

10%
: Class participation

15%
: Lab project 1 (text markup)

20%
: Lab project 2 (reading interfaces)

15%
: Paper proposal

40%
: Final paper

All assignments must be submitted in either English or French. The [*MHRA Style Guide*](http://mhra.org.uk/style) is an open-access guide to academic writing conventions. The citation format of the [*Chicago Manual of Style*](http://chicagomanualofstyle.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/) is widely used in the humanities and social sciences (including this syllabus). Any citation style may be used in this course as long as it is consistent.

Your written work will be graded based on the analytical writing rubric available on the course website. The Faculty of Information [Grade Interpretation Guidelines](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/grade-interpretation.pdf) provides criteria for the letter grades assigned.

## Lab projects

These assignments, completed in groups of two to three people, provide the opportunity to demonstrate the skills acquired during the instructed lab portions of our classes. The subgroups for this assignment should identify themselves to me by 30 January, after which I will assign group members arbitrarily.

For both assignments, one member should submit all materials on behalf of the group. Please ensure that all group members' names are included on the report.

### Lab project 1: Text markup (due 16 February)

This group assignment introduces the complexities of digitally modelling print and manuscript materials, as well as other types of texts that pose a challenge to represent digitally. Select a text from the examples provided (or choose your own), and mark it up using HTML tags.

This involves making choices about which aspects of the original to encode, and how to contend with the structural constraints of tags. Along with the file containing your text, submit a rationale, around 800 words long, explaining the choices you made and the problems you encountered. You will be graded on your use of semantic tagging; whether or not your HTML file validates; and the arguments 

### Lab project 2: Reading interfaces (due 28 March)

Turn your text into a digital book with a reading interface, starting with the templates provided, and produce versions in both HTML and EPUB, using your knowledge of CSS to format the pages correctly.

The submitted assignment will include the following files:

1. An HTML version of your book designed for viewing in a web browser.
2. An EPUB file designed for use with e-readers.
3. A report of around 1,500–1,800 words, with an edited version of your rationale for the choices you made in the encoding, reflecting on how the process of digitization can lead to new ways to understand the material. The report should draw upon appropriate secondary sources in markup theory and practice.

This assignment will be graded on the appropriateness of the selected material, the clarity and critical strength of the written rationale, the quality of the writing, and how well the submitted documents reflect concepts discussed in class and readings up to this point.

## Final paper

Your final project should draw upon primary and secondary sources to advance an original argument related to any of the themes of the course. It can take any one of a number of approaches, such as: 

- a review of a particular digital resource (or group of them), similar to those published by the [*RIDE* journal](http://ride.i-d-e.de);
- an exploration of a theoretical question;
- an analysis of a key historical moment in the development of the book;
- a critical reading of a particular tool or born-digital artefact;
- an analysis of a social phenomenon related to the history of books and reading;
- or another approach that builds on the readings, concepts, and focus of the course.

### Proposal (due 6 February)

Submit a summary and outline of your intended argument, no more than 700 words long (point-form is acceptable). I am open to unconventional approaches to this assignment, such as papers that combine traditional academic writing with a design experiment or mock-up.

For further guidance, see [Writing Advice: The Academic Proposal](http://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/types-of-writing/academic-proposal/).

### Final submission (due 5 April)

The final product should be in the range of 3,000–3,500 words, excluding notes and bibliography.

## Analytical writing rubric

This table shows the criteria used for marking both the final project and the written portion of the lab assignments (taking into account the different requirements). Papers are given a grade out of 100 points.
