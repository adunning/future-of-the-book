## Communication

You are always welcome to drop by with questions during office hours; I am available at other times by appointment. I usually respond to email messages by the end of the next business day. Official course announcements will be sent occasionally to your University of Toronto email address.

## Late work

Assignments will only be accepted after the deadline with prior permission (which, except in emergencies, must be requested at least three days in advance of the deadline via email).

## Academic integrity

Academic integrity is fundamental to learning and scholarship. You are expected to know and follow the University of Toronto's [Code of Student Conduct](http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/studentc.htm) and [Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters](http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm). See the university's [Academic Integrity](http://academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/) website.

## Accessibility and support

If we can help you to succeed through academic accommodations, please see me and contact [Accessibility Services](http://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as) as soon as possible.

The [Graduate Centre for Academic Communication](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/currentstudents/Pages/GCAC.aspx) offers training in writing and speaking to all students, including [workshops](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/currentstudents/Pages/Current-Years-Courses.aspx). The [iSkills Workshops](https://inforum.library.utoronto.ca/workshops/iSkills) provide training in many other areas.
